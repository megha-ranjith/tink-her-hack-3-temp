### Project Description
WOW (Wellness on Women) is a revolutionary wellness platform designed exclusively for women to seamlessly manage their self-care and daily lives. It empowers users through personalized interfaces, connecting them to resources, enhancing their productivity, and supporting women entrepreneurs‚Äîall in one dynamic ecosystem.

### The Problem statement
Women often face challenges in prioritizing their well-being amidst busy schedules. Whether it's finding time for self-care, discovering resources, or supporting women-led businesses, the lack of a unified platform makes these tasks cumbersome.

### The Solution
WOW simplifies wellness by offering:

- A personalized dashboard for self-care and productivity.
- An online class finder for fitness, hobbies, and skill-building.
- A marketplace to support women entrepreneurs and discover unique, handcrafted products.
